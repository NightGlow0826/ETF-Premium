This Project focus on ETF premium

I roughly put it into 3 steps:
1. calculate the IOPV over ETF price. Since 1 tick per 3 seconds is far from HFT, let's just use the 3-min tick. This is easy to change though.
2. Use technical indicators to analyze. My tutor taught me ETF has a more rational and predictable behavior than generic stock analysis. So I shall first try that.
3. Actually, I've always been curious about the indicators. I think most of'em cannot pass even the hypothesis tests. Maybe I could try that this time
4. Use machine learning. Although basing on my own experience, the info/noise ratio is extremely low. Maybe the genetic algorithm or some books dynamics would save it.
